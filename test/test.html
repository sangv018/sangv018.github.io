            <div class="answer">
                Git is more of a version control system that allows one to track their progress and manage the files source code history. Whereas GitHub works like a hosting service that permits you to manage and control all your Git repositories and files. It is almost like a database. Another difference is that Git is installed locally and Github is online.
